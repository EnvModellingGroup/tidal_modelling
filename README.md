# Tidal Modelling

This repo contains a bunch of scripts and script-lets of various stages of usefulness that are used to pre- and post-processing tidal modelling simulations in Fluidity. These can range from global to localised models. Scripts are usually generated for a one-off analysis, but bits may be useful in future.
